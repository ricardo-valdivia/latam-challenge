The challenge was not completed due to time constraints, but I would still like to provide the rationale for why I would have applied logistic regression. This choice is based on the greater interpretability of the said model. Given that the relationship between features was not complex enough to compromise accuracy, as evidenced by the results. In the given context, it is important to understand which variables contribute to the presence or absence of delay, a capability provided by the model's interpretability.

Furthermore, while I have experience with APIs, I have not yet developed one from scratch. Similarly, my proficiency with GitHub and the use of Gitflow development practices is not as advanced as initially stated, making it challenging to complete the CI/CD setup. However, I believe that I possess the knowledge to apply these concepts in the future.
